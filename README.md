# Drake's Site
You should be able to see two files here - a `README.md` and an `index.html`. What you're currently reading comes from the `README.md` file, and the website you'll be working on is the `index.html` file.

The URL for your website is [https://frehner.github.io/drake/](https://frehner.github.io/drake/)

## Getting Started
You can either click on the `Download` button and download a zip file, or you can open up the `index.html` file and just copy and paste the contents to a new `index.html` file on your computer.

## Making Changes
Once on your computer, you can right click the file and open it with a text editor to make changes. It can be as basic as just the Notepad app, or you can download something nice like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org).  You will also want to open (usually by double clicking) that file in your favorite browser, and that's where you'll see your work! 

Look for the section that I made for you; that's where you can do all your work.

## Developer Tools
Anytime you save your `index.html` file, you can reload your webpage and you'll see the newest changes. You should also open the Developer Tools to see if your code has any errors in it (in Chrome you can press the `F12` button to open that up, and then look for a section called `Console`.) If there are any errors, they'll show up there.

## Saving your website to the internet
Once you've added what you like to your site, come back to the `index.html` file here and click on the edit button. Then you can copy and paste the changes you made to your page on your computer into that file and save the changes (it will say "Commit Changes"). Once that's done, you (and anyone else!) should be able to go to that URL above and see your work!
